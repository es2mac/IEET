## Considering Evaluation: Ilona Holland

Dr. Ilona Holland, consultant and formative evaluator 


### Evaluation

Systematic gathering of feedback to inform a decision.  More study than research.

- Two stages
    - During development of a product/program, to inform development
    - At the end, summative assessment, outcome for intended users

- Steps and things to think about to evaluate a technology:
    - Articulate goals & desired outcomes (be specific)
    - Think about your criteria for success (there are many types)
    - Identify measures (how do you measure those criteria)
    - Consider your ability to make changes (for example, if the project
      sucked, you might not have the power to discard it, but think about what
      kind of feedback is needed for desired outcomes)
    - For the outcomes in mind, are they norms, ideal, interim etc.?

- Good evaluation is often not a dichotomy.  It can be for summative assessment
  with clear goals, but rarely the case for formative assessment.


### Factors that formative evaluators look at

- Appeal: Does it appear to the users, especially products for children

- Interest: Does it make users take more interest in the subject

- Comprehension: Do users get/remember the concepts or knowledge

- Pacing: Machinery may not notice a need to go faster or slower like a real
  life teacher

- Usability: Is it intuitive to use in its natural usage setting


### Phases of evaluation

People tend to think of evaluation at the end, but there's so much more that one can do in the early stages.

- Front-end evaluation
    - Needs assessment: Review and document what's out there, and what the end
      users want and need

- Design/production phase
    - Test with paper prototypes and storyboards
    - Systematically collect feedback to know if the design would work

- Implementation phase
    - See if it works with actual users in the actual environment
    - Test usability

- Outcome/summative phases
    - Are we getting the results wanted


### Example: New vocabulary TV program

Vocabulary videos to show on TV.  Considering the factors above, some of the things done: 

- Pre-test, and immediately post-test
- Asked kids how much they liked it
- Asked kids to re-tell the story
- Asked vocabulary questions with contextual clue (from the videos).  See that
  words all moved along the word-understanding continuum

Found the words "add" and "subtract," though both appeared 15 times, "add" was learned much better because it was presented with very concrete graphics


### Example: Digital encyclopedia (EncycloMedia) in Mexico

At the time it wasn't yet fully implemented.

**Heuristic evaluation**: Randomly assigned different chapters of textbook to compare textbook & interactive textbook against a rubrics for critical thinking
