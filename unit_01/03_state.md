## State-Level Strategies and Standards

- Interview with Barbara Treacy, continued

### States

- Create funding streams

- Responsible for ed tech governing policies

- (High-impact examples, difficult to summarize)

- Impacts how & whether initiatives spread

- State's expectations/policy may promote success:
    - Require districts that receive funding to elaborate on their goals
    - Expect professional learning to be a part of implementation

### Standards

- E.g. Common Core

- Almost any standard has a media/tech component to it

- Technology integrated into content, and support content goals, more important than having a separate set of technology standards

### Vision for How Technology Changes Future Classrooms

- New ways to connect students/teachers/community

- Bring the world into the classroom, classroom connects to the world

- Meet individual learning needs
