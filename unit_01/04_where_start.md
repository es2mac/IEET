## Where Do We Start?

- Interview with Justin Reich, MIT/HarvardX

- Another stakeholder perspective: Ed tech specialist, instructional technology
  coach

- Where do we start to implement ed tech?
    - First question: What are the learning goals, what is it that you're
      trying to learn?
    - "What does awesome look like?"
    - NOT: "What's a new tool I can play with?"
    - (Personal note: This is exactly the same for data science)


### Target of Difficulty

- Idea by Stone Wiske

- Ed tech in classrooms is the intersection of three ideas: The thing you're
  trying to teach should be:
    - Important to learn
    - Hard to teach
    - Technology may offer some kind of leverage

### Classrooms That Successfully Incorporates Technology

- Real focus on learning goals, formative assessments

- Ambituous learning goals
    - Most technology gets used to extend existing practices, perhaps with
      moderate gain in efficiency
    - How can we be really ambitious about imagining new ways for students to
      learn and demonstrate their learnings?

- Sense of partnership with students
    - Teachers don't have all the answers, work together on the technology

- Lots of external support for teachers
    - Informed and supportive parents
    - School administration, giving permission and encouraging to experiment

### Challenges

- It's easy to lose track of the most important things
    - Easy to get fixated on the logistics of technology, and lose track of the
      pedagogy of technology

- Make sure technology is always in the service of learning goals
