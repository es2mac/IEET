## SAMR

- Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition: Conceptual model by Dr. Rupert Puentedura

- Interview with Ingrid Gustafson, instructional technology specialist

### Instructional Technology Specialist

- Works with teachers on finding appropriate technology to integrate into their
  curriculum

- Might also do hardware

- Be in the forefront of technology, but NOT technology just for the sake of
  technology

- Often asked by teachers: Is there an app for that?  Is there a way
  to make this easier?
    - Teachers too busy to keep up with the fast-moving tech world

- Important to meet people at their own comfort level with technology
    - Make teachers comfortable and gain trust

### SAMR

- A way to think of integrating technology as a continuum (not necessarily in
  this order)
    - Substituting out a tool
    - Augmenting a lesson
    - Modify a lesson
    - Redefining how to teach

- Substitution is an easy entry point
    - Swap in technology to make things a little smoother
    - Can lead to augmentation and modification
    - Not necessarily a bad thing
