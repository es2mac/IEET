## Reading: In Classroom of Future, Stagnant Scores

[In Classroom of Future, Stagnant Scores](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/technology/technology-in-schools-faces-questions-on-value.html) (NYT 2011)

TL;DR: It's complicated, hard to balance spending, and we don't know how to
measure the effects of increasing tech

- The Kyrene School District invested ~$33 million since 2005 in technologies
  like the digital whiteboard.

- Lots of hope and enthusiasm, but test scores are not rising.  No good proof
  that all the tech investment is worth it.

- Perhaps currently there's no good way to measure the breadth of skills that
  computers can help develop, besides test scores.

- Historically, President Clinton in 1997 urged to equip schools with technology
    - Supporters argues we can't wait till research confirmation, risking
      competitiveness
    - The proof is still elusive even today

- Case studies show rising reading and math scores
    - But it's hard to separate the effect of the teacher training

- Laptop programs may merely amplify difference in teacher's teaching aptitude

- In sum, some believe there's simply insufficient evidence for large
  investments

- Students learn to use the internet for research, organize their work, collaborate with others

- Some teachers say technology is the only way to make this generation learn
    - But constant novelty is unsustainable

- A key argument: student engagement
    - Again no reliable research that says engagement leads to higher academic
      achievement

- Instruct or Distract?

- Budget cuts means class size grew, even with increased technology, students
  get less access to teachers

- It's a big business
