[Comparative Analysis of National Teacher Surveys](http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jgcc_teacher_survey_analysis_final.pdf)

- Overview of 5 surveys from 2012-2013, on K-12 teachers' practices around &
  attitudes toward technology

- From each survey take the goals, dates & respondent demographics, and topline
  findings

### Survey Goals

In summary:

- What teachers think of (ed tech, game-based learning)
- How they impact students, academically and beyond
- How teachers currently use them
- Existing barriers
- Teachers' training needs

### Cross-Survey Themes

- JGCC: 95% teachers use games specifically for education, most often with
  literacy & math

- PBS: Teachers use interactive games, online video, online images
    - Tablets: most beneficial are ed apps > ed websites > e-books

- PRC: Teachers have students do research online, access assignments online,
  submit assignments online

- Devices used: PC/Mac > interactive whiteboard > tablets
    - Others: Projectors, cell phones, cameras, video cameras, e-book readers
    - Use varies by teacher age and subject taught

- Teacher's confidence with technology:
    - Decrease with age
    - English teachers most likely to use online collaboration tools, math
      least likely
    - Rural teachers most confident, small-town teachers least

### Benefits of Technology for Student Learning

- Increased motivation and engagement
- Personalize instruction, better assess knowledge, collect useful data
- Respond to variety of learning styles
- Promote positive collaborations
- Help sustain focus
- Help find information efficiently

### Barriers

- Access to technology, in classroom or at home
- Lack of time for planning
- Emphasis on standardized testing
- Education reform fatigue
- Technology as a distraction
- Skepticism to the benefit of technology

### Professional Development

- Training sources: Peers > self-taught > seminars/conferences
- Lack of training is often a barrier, and teachers generally feel they do not
  get adequate training
- most teachers use online resources, but not often for connecting with other
  teachers
- PRC: 68% report that school/district provides formal training on digital
  technology

### Synthesis

- Teachers need more proof
- Emphasis on learning processes and higher-level skills rather than on
  academic achievement, i.e. skeptical whether it'll improve test scores
- Not much exploration w.r.t. Common Core Standards
- Nor much about assessment
- What about the students' roles?
