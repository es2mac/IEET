## Assignment 1.1: Profile Your Implementation Context

Introduce us to the implementation context you want to use for your project by
creating a profile that describes and illuminates important characteristics.

- Tell us about your target environment.
- Help us learn about one key stakeholder.
- Explain why there is potential for technology to be implemented in this
  context. 

### My Submission

#### Target environment:

In a rural town of eastern Taiwan, there’s a church, in collaboration with a non-profit organization, that offers a free study hall program for kids.

Students, mainly grade 3~9, may come in to study and do homeworks with other kids under the assistance and supervision of volunteer teachers.

There’s a high percentage of kids in this area who come from single-parent families, skipped generation families, and immigrant families. They sometimes have behavioral issues, low self-esteem, and are often behind in academics.

#### Stakeholders:

Other than the kids, their family, and school, one key stakeholder in this setting is the administrators of the church and NPO.

To the church and NPO, academic success is important but not the number one priority for these kids. The top goal is to accompany the kids so they become better persons, not led astray and possibly come to know God. That said, providing academic support is still an important mean to those goals.

#### Potential for Technology:

For kids with low confidence, technology might provide incentives for them to give learning a try, and not decide to give up too quickly. It might also attract them to come to the study group more regularly, since they’re not really obligated or forced to come in the first place.

The other potential is to provide instructions when the volunteer teachers are not entirely qualified to do so. Volunteers may not be subject experts, so when students need help for a certain topic, they may not be able to help. This may be especially the case for certain subjects such as computer science.

Since we’re supposed to “dream big,” let’s add another possibility, that is to connect the backwater kids to the larger world. Too often the kids in rural towns know of only their tiny world, because they don’t get to travel, and information is limited. By interacting with the larger world through technology, hopefully it’ll let students have a broader perspective and inspire them to dare to have bigger dreams about their future.
