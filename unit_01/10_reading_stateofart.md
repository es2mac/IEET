[State-of-the-art education software often doesn’t help students learn more, study finds](http://hechingerreport.org/even-high-end-education-software-gets-mixed-results-improved-learning/)

Research, funded by the Gates Foundation, found adaptive learning softwares to have disappointing results.  Report found:

- The software in and of itself isn’t a magical teacher
    - Students still need things like incentives
    - Effect depends on how teachers adapts teaching to the software

- Universities aren’t monitoring whether the technology they’re using is working
    - They aren't prepared to measure the effects in a rigorous way, so no
      getting valid comparisons
