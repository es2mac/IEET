## Overview

Eric's story of implementing StarLogo.

- A biology teacher was having students do simulations etc., but was asked to
  stop because of parents complaint

- Conducted a joint unit test on both basic knowledge and additional scientific
  concepts, the latter showed a difference

- Implementation of ed tech is hard, system is complex

- People who seems to stand in the way are just there to test the system, and
  make sure there's accountability
