## Educational Technology Start-Ups

- Jean Hammond @ [LearnLaunch](http://learnlaunch.com)


### Perspectives & Problems

- Ed tech is blossoming, products for curriculum and also school efficiency and
  operations

- Confusion of too many great ideas, many hasn't been integrated enough

- Biggest problem: doing enough testing to show what people like and what works

- History of slow, long trials vs. startup culture of quick iterations


### Collaboration between schools and industry

- The Gates foundation pioneering some small trials

- Teachers doing self organized discussions and product discoveries

- What the technologists should know: What a complex workday looks like in the
  classroom

- What the teachers should know: This is a business, involving much more than
  just a great idea


### The ed tech industry

- Have difficult buyers

- Christmas in July (buying frenzy)

- Schools listens to their peers a lot

- Ed tech startups often takes an extra year to start effectively selling


### Advice for start-ups

- Schools are on a wide range scale of tech readiness

- Find a quick way to assess possible markets

- Common pattern: freemium -> data collection and/or storage of students work
  to move clients behind the paywall


### More on collaboration between schools and industry

- Test, do trials quickly, allow teachers to get familiar with what
  does/doesn't work

- Let teachers learn what they should look for

- Possibly let students be involved in the tools selection process (they
  usually love it)


### Technology as game changer vs. as distraction

- Distractable people are distractable

- If you find things that are engaging, folks are going to use it


### Expectation of educational products being free

- In fact school districts have lots of budget, and big players like Pearson
  aren't giving things for free

- It may take some re-thinking, re-channeling of budgets


### Confusing decisions process

- Often not clear which stakeholder is the one making decisions

- No consistency across regions and schools

- A difficult area for schools to manage & for startups to understand

- Some companies target the principal discrenary funds with a light price point
    - Like a light trial process


### Story of CueThink

- Cause students to think about strategies for solving math

- Strategic partnership with Dexter U. to bring out more content with the
  methodology

- Teacher's workflow needs some change, so required training

- More challenge, but more transformative than simple math memorization products


### Process of change

- Initially a good part of products are just translation to digital from paper

- Transformative products start leaking in afterwards, after a system that can
  adopt them is in place

- One new step may lead to another, e.g. project based learning -> need for
  assessment


### Common mistakes

- Not understanding data privacy & security requirements


### Advice for teachers and schools

- Teachers need to be well supported, and given time to learn new things

- Trials of different products are happening independently across schools, next
  step may be trying to compare and contrast at a district level
