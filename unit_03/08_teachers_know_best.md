## Teachers Know Best: Teachers' Views on Professional Development

- Gates Foundation, 2014

- Research report on **professional development** for teachers, including
  current states, barriers, market and future needs

- A typical teacher spends 68 hours each year on professional development, 89
  hours counting self-guided learning

- Few teachers (29 percent) are highly satisfed with current professional
  development offerings.


### What teachers want

The ideal professional development experience is...

- Relevant (personalized)
- Interactive (hands-on, participatory)
- Delivered by someone who understands my experience (not top-down)
- Sustained over time
- Treats teachers like pros, rather than children


### A problem of execution

There's a real disconnect between teachers satisfaction vs. districts / school admins wants.  That is, districts want more of certain things, that teachers are just not satisfied with their delivery, especially in...

- Professional learning communities
- Coaching
- Lesson observation


### Compliance versus learning

For many teachers, PD is unfortunately viewed as a compliance exercise, and had no choice.  Teachers who do have more choice are way more satisfied.


### What are the barriers?

- No. 1 barrier: not enough time for PD
- School leaders don't have time to spend on instruction because of admin tasks
- School leaders don't have time to support teacher PD

What are NOT barriers?

- Finding external PD resource
- District leadership making PD a priority
- External PD resource quality


### Supply and the market

PD market is highly fragmented, and most PD budget is internal investment.  That means PD isn't subject to market forces at all, i.e. doesn't work like a typical market.

Independent consultants play an outsized role in providing professional development services to districts.  Majority of services by external providers are focused on services, rather than content and their platforms.


### Understanding what works

Studies showed that PD that improves student achievement is sustained, content specific, aligned with standards, involve active learning techniques, include established teams and use data in making instructional decisions.

However, evaluation remains challenging, and local decision makers tend to turn to their personal networks for info about providers.


### Promising innovations

Such as: content aggregation platforms, collaboration tools, data analysis tools.
