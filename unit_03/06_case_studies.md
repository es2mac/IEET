## Case Studies


### MinecraftEDU

- Joel Levin, co-founder of TeacherGaming LLC (creator of Minecraft: Education Edition)

- Minecraft is very flexible, different game modes, but also extensible

- MinecraftEDU adds tools useful for teachers
    - Made modding easily accessible for less technical users, with buttons and
      blocks
    - Layer in classroom management tools on top of Minecraft's vocabulary

- Teachers need to at least play the game his/herself to understand the inner
  workings of the game

- Joel facilitates collaborations in the Minecraft/MinecraftEDU community

- Parent resistance
    - Screen time, and balance between play & responsibilities
    - Joel argues it's good use of screen time, and opens childrens' eyes to
      their potential
    - Encourage parents to play with their children, or encourage children to
      deeper into what they're passionate about
