### Standardized tests can drive technology implementation

- People at schools are very good at adapting

- People will use technology to meet the goals in front of them
    - Recent years schools are accountability-driven
    - E.g. reading & math remedial instructions
    - Standardized testing has a big problem with time-lag, so schools invested
      in computer-adaptive systems that gives results next day, to help
      students advancing in standardized tests


### Factors that lead to success

- Having a policy context where the goals support implementation
    - If states are pushing for stardardized assessments, teachers and admins
      will align their practices around them

- For schools to recognize how kids are learning now

- The new digital divide
    - Kids have much of the same technology, but those who knows how to use
      them to amplify their learning experience will be able to succeed more;
      for example, collaboration
    - We need to help kids adopt those same models

- Schools should think of not only presenting information during school time,
  but also orchestrate the environments in which students learn on their own
    - E.g. use learning management systems in smart ways
