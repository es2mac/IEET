### Effective professional development for teachers

- Long-term
    - A lot of hours, spread out
    - Committed over a year or more

- Job-embedded


### Challenges

- Ways that schools set up PD: a series of one-off meetings on different topics

- A lot of times the PD given isn't of high quality

- Schools spending orders of magnitude more on hardware than on people


### Mindsets

- Be open about the mistakes made

- Be open to stakeholders that we don't know everything
    - Just like becoming a parent


### Professional development not just for teachers

- For leaders, policymakers, technicians


### More challenges

- Tech is fast-moving
    - Everyone's busy
    - Keeping up with constant change is a big challenge

- Not reinventing the wheel

- APPS: Adult Paradigm Paralysis Syndrome
    - The users, 12-year-old students, have world views completely different
      than adults
    - Don't overly complicate the system
    - Things adults worry most like computers stolen, students off-task etc.,
      often turns out not the biggest issues, compared to say PD and new ways
      to assess knowledge
