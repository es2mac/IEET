## Barriers

- Jennifer Groff @ MIT explains the i5 framework


### What is the i5 framework

- Result of meta-synthesis of research studies

- What are the dimensions of barriers to edtech adoption?


### How to use the i5 framework?

- For teacher thinking of using a new tech, use it to identify potential
  challenges/barriers, and mitigate the risks

- To help think of the factors, rather than for evaluation


### The barriers

- Often the word "technology" can be replaced with "innovation"

- Research & policy
- The school
- The teacher
- The students
- The project
- The technology


## Observations

- We have a ton of technologies, not being used much

- Often it's not a problem with the technology, but the structures, policy and
  practices don't allow for change

- More schools are starting to realize we need better ways to explore and
  redesign
