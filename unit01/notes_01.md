Unit 1: Foundations
===================

## Overview

### Stakeholders

1. Students
	- Actual users

2. Teachers

3. Parents and administrators

4. Ed tech companies

### Evaluation

- Assessment (in education): A moment you step back and document a state of
  being.

- Evaluation: 
	- Formative: When developing a product/program, systematic feedback
	  gathering
	- Summative: After a product/program is completed, looking at how well it
	  meets the goal

- Broadly speaking...
	- Creativity
	- Collaboration
	- Communication
	- Breadth and Depth
	- Flexibility
	- Personalization and differentiation

## Spotlight on the Administrator

- Interview with Barbara Treacy
- Blended learning: Offline + online modes which are connected

### Administrator's Roles in Implementing Ed Tech in School

- Leaders, making decisions and goals

- Setting the tone and creating the culture

- Administrator who is successful at implementing ed tech:
	- Understands that change is complicated and messy, and have all
	  stakeholders understand that
	- Is focused on clear goals
	- Knows that it's not a horse race, and collaborate with others

- Start with the **goal**, not the **technology**

- Step away from the question of _what to buy/use_, and instead...
	- Ask _what are the learning needs and challenges_, and the technology will
	  emerge from that
	- Ask _who's behind (in support of) this_
	- Ask _are all stakeholders informed_

- What teachers need to know about administrators:
	- They have a lot of stakeholders and responsibilities
	- Make sure they know what you're doing and why
	- Believe they want to support you, and ask how you can help them achieve
	  their goals

- What administrators need to know about teachers:
	- They want to know they're suported
	- They want to know there's a grounding in what they're being asked to do
	- They want to know the tools/tech have continual support

- What do developers need to know about administrators:
	- Be respectful for their time, because there's a lot of competitors, and
	  administrators are super busy
	- The tools they create have to be very easy to use
	- Users need to know their data are safe, but also needs access to it
	- Have more conversation during the development process

### Successful Ed Tech Strategies for Schools

- Have very, very clear goals

- Have strong focus on professional learning
	- Not just about using the tools, but about content and pedagogy
	- Admins & teachers are both participating in
	- One way to (try) lowering entry floor: Use the tools themselves in
	  professional training, e.g. teachers learn how to teach online, in an
	  online course

- Have long range view to funding
	- E.g. what happens after the iPads start breaking down?
