## Activity Break: Popcorn Popper or Chef's Knife?

Find a digital, educational game that is either like a popcorn popper or like a chef's knife. Tell us why you think so.  Next, briefly consider how a teacher might use the game in a classroom

### My Submission

I have two games to share, one is a popcorn popper, the other is a chef's knife.

<a href="http://www.countingkingdomgame.com" title="The Counting Kingdom" target="_blank">The Counting Kingdom</a> is a math game for kids.  The game can be simply described as "tower defense using addition."  It's great because not only is the game mechanics fundamentally dependent on the concepts it is aiming to teach, it is also genuinely fun.  It is a popcorn popper, because it teaches one thing and one thing only.

I don't know if this game can be adapted into the classroom, other than the teacher might let the students play them in class, or introduce them for self-learning at home.

<a href="https://www.pagamo.org" title="PaGamO" target="_blank">PaGamO</a> is a educational gaming platform.  It is a territory control game, where players fight for territories by answering questions.  These can be any questions that the teachers designate.  Therefore it is more of a chef's knife, such that it can be adapted to any subject or topic, and can be incorporated into the curriculum in many different ways.

One way to use PaGamO in the classroom, as it was originally conceived, is to let the students form informal factions that fight each other in-game, and students have to make questions for the game on the topics they're currently learning, e.g. probability and statistics.  It would be a fun way for students to explore or review the course materials outside of the grading requirements.  I doubt it'll be a fair way to use the in-game performance as part of the formal grades though.
