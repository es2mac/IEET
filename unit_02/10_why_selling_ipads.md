## Why Some Schools Are Selling All Their iPads

- [2014 Article: The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/08/whats-the-best-device-for-interactive-learning/375567/)

- Los Angeles Unified Schools rolled out iPads, but quickly recalled some &
  offered choices.  Previously North Carolina and Texas schools backed up on
  iPad programs

- Hillsborough, NJ 2012-2013 cautiously did half iPads & half Chromebooks; by
  2014 replaced iPads with Chromebooks
    - Now also has Nexus tablets

- Why iPads were edged out at Hillsborough:
    - iPad was seen as "fun", Chromebook seen as place to work
    - Keyboard, esp. for Common Core's online testing
    - Tech support: Far easier to manage Chromebooks since all files live on
      the cloud
    - Googleâ€™s Apps for Education suite easier to use collaboratively on
      Chromebooks (which Hillsborough emphasizes)

- Current education market: Fairly evenly split
    - Laptop market is varied but tablets are mostly iPads

- Other cases of having all iPads, or even both, or hybrids

- Some working on shifting responsibilities to home, i.e. BYOD
