- Good teacher always thinks about what tools can I bring into the classroom
  that can improve over current practice
    - Compare and evaluate new vs. old tools and practices using these
      frameworks

- Framework for selecting what technology to use, split in two halves:
  **Logistical** and **Instructional**.

- Two halves are both important interrelated and interdependent, with different
  relative weight depending on the exact situation

### Logistical

- Cost
    - Free, freemium, paid by...

- Access
    - E.g. If your students have 1:1 Chromebooks, what do they have/not have
      access to
    - Consider smartphones

- Special needs accessibility

- Usability
    - How easy is it to learn, how long does it take to get started

- Flexibility
    - Analogy: Popcorn popper vs. chef's knife, or: specialized software vs.
      spreadsheets

### Instructional

- Quality of learning

- Efficiency of learning

- Collateral skill development

- Creation of opportunity
