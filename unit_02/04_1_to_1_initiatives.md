## 1:1 Initiatives

- 1:1 includes having school give everyone a Chromebook/iPad, or BYOD


### Readiness Rubric: Stacey Allen

- Interview with Stacey Allen @ Digital Promise

- Rubric is in this unit's reading

- School leader can go through the rubric and look at each metric, self-assess
  their readiness to implement a 1:1 program

- Example: Teacher training

- Example: Infrastructure, schools had problems at first with iPad 1:1, limited
  internet capacity & access points etc., more recently not so much of a problem

- Example: Think about the device and beyond, such as tablet vs. laptop have
  different use cases

- A lot of schools' want for technology were driven by wanting to be perceived
  as innovative, but they should really focus on why & how to use tech


### MLTI

- Jeff Mao @ Common Sense Media talks about the [Maine Learning Technology Initiative](http://maine.gov/mlti/), a state-wide program

The story:

- MLTI began in 2002, born through conversations of the governor with
  businesses & Seymour Papert, who gave him the idea of getting to 1:1

- One year the state had a budget surplus, thus began the process

- Legislature created a task force made up of a wide variety of stakeholders

- With state support, implementing and changing things' feedback loop was
  relatively fast in terms of state government

Experiences of the students and teachers:

- For students, the experience of getting a laptop (say at 7th grade) was fully
  accepted as normal
    - Though this is really quite special
    - The normalcy to it changed the way we interact with content, with
      information and with each other; much like how touchscreens are accepted
      by kids as the norm nowadays

- For teachers, there's also a commonality of community, in that there's no
  question that all other teachers also have computers, and discussing their
  usage is a common thing
    - Essentially, all teachers of given grade level in Maine are in the program
    - Teachers get the same devices, the consistency simplifies support
    - This "structure" liberates, rather than confines

On selecting software:

- Purpose
    - Basis in the beginning: What we want to be able to do
        - Not focusing on style/genre of software
    - Most provided softwares are not really "educational" softwares
        - More focused on what teachers do generically in classrooms

- Ease of use

- Scalability
    - E.g. cloud-based software, how to generate 15,000 accounts and usernames,
      and group them in classes?
      
- Data privacy and handling
    - Info about student identity and performance are private

- Accessibility
    - Opportunity to drive the developer community to build in universal designs
    - Not only for the impaired, but also addressing different learning modes

Two lavels of looking at software for kids/teachers use:

- System level

- Local level, can add more

- The formal process is deeply informed by constant feedback loop with all the
  stakeholders, though often not a big group of people

Measuring success:

- Some anecdotal, others collaborate with outside evaluator

- Also from the political angle: The program persisted through 3 governors,
  still going.  Policy makers saw it with their own eyes and started to also
  believe in it
    - Past the stage of "I need more research!"
