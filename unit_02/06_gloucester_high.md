## Gloucester High School Visit

- Interview with Carol Cafasso and Eric Leigh, teachers at Gloucester High

### Carol

- Pharmacist, and chemistry teacher

- Technologies are natural to students, making it a block in their thinking

- Tech used: Vernier software and probes
    - Visualize things the students couldn't before
    - Using those that she knows will work, will help her achieve the
      objectives of her lab

- Frequently asking students questions, and during that can see if tech is
  helping students

### Eric

- Biology teacher, teaches a forensic science class

- Tech used:
    - Gloucester uses Chromebooks, lots of cloud-based applications
    - Google Suite, easy to edit, but limited
    - Have a website to access/submit things
    - Remind: a blind texting service
    - JogNog: student questionnaire based on Bio MCAS test

- Barriers to implementing tech:
    - Access (e.g. to the Chromebooks cart), bandwidth
    - Finding time to prep and plan

- Getting started
    - Start with dialogue between students and teachers
    - Did a course site through Google Site
    - Would've loved a learning management platform that can incorporate
      assessment

- Downside of using tech:
    - Things breaks, internet goes down, at most unfortunate times
    - Difficulty of switching from teacher-directed to student-directed
      learning, and have them take responsibility (though it's not so different
      from having disengaged students in class)
