- A framework that combines three knowledge areas
    - Content: The "What"
    - Pedagogy: The "How"
    - Technology: The partner

- In the intersections of T, P and C:
    - Technological pedagogical knowledge: How to make content more accessible
    - Technological content knowledge: Pairing technology with content
    - Pedagogical content knowledge: Pairing pedagogical strategy with content
    - In the middle of all three: Sweet spot

- All in the context of you & your students
