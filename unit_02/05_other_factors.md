## Other Factors Impacting Selections

- Interview with Ingrid Gustafson

- Hardware: What type of technology do curriculum leaders need, price, how many
  (1:1 or shared cart)

- Software: Similar, and has to work with the hardware

- Looking at terms of services, and privacy policy
    - Also making sure teachers know different companies handle data differently
    - Special concerns for kids under 13
    - No consistent standards for privacy yet

- Case study of an integration that didn't go as planned
    - Had students each set up his/her own blog
    - Too much going on, didn't gain traction
    - Might have turned out better with a different tool, or prime the students
      on blogging etc.
